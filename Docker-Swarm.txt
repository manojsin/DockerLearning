Step 1: create Docker machine(act as node for docker swarm)
        create one machine as manager and other sa workers
        install docker-machine command= curl -L https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.16.0/docker-machine-`uname -s`-`uname -m` >/tmp/docker-machine && chmod +x /tmp/docker-machine && sudo cp /tmp/docker-machine /usr/local/bin/docker-machine
        check docker-machine version=
        
        command =: docker-machine create --driver virtualbox manager1
        Error with pre-create check: "VBoxManage not found. Make sure VirtualBox is installed and VBoxManage is in the path"
        install VirtualBox
        command=:sudo apt-get install virtualbox
        create one manager and other worker
        
step 2: check machine created successfully
        command =: docker-machine ls
        command =: docker-machine ip manager1
        
step 3: SSH(connect)to docker machine
        command =: docker-machine ssh manager1
       
step 4: initialize docker swarm
        command =: docker swarm init --advertise-addr managerip
        command =: docker node ls (command only will work in manager not in worker)
      
step 5 : join worker in swarm
        command =: docker swarm join-token worker (wiil give command to join swarm as worker)
        command =: docker swarm join-token manager1 (wiil give command to join swarm as manager1)
        
step 6: on manager runn standard command 
       command =: docker info   (will give number of manager , node etc)
       now check docker swarm command options
       command =: docker swarm
